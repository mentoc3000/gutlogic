Conquer your food sensitivities to improve your digestive health, energy, and overall wellness.

Do you have unexplained digestive issues? Feel cloudy? Low energy? It might be what you’re eating! Take control of your life with Gut Logic™. Gut Logic™ can help you discover how the foods you eat affect the way you feel. Search thousands of built-in foods or create your own custom foods and meals to track what you eat in a way that works best for you!

The Pantry is your personal guide to which foods you should avoid. Keep track of your food sensitivities so as you meal plan, grocery shop, and dine out you never have to wonder if something will make you sick.

The unique Timeline view can help you identify causes and effects that you may miss with other diaries and manual tracking methods. The Timeline is your day-to-day log, tracking the foods you eat, bowel movements, and symptoms to discover links between what you eat and how you feel.

As always, please consult with your doctor if you’re not feeling well.
