Thank you for volunteering to beta test Gut Logic, an app to help people identify and manage their food sensitivities.

This version adds barcode scanning to the Gut Logic Premium features. Try scanning some barcodes in your pantry or even the grocery store!

Spend a few days with the app and send any feedback to dev@gutlogic.co. We will accept feedback on this beta version until Jan 6. Thanks in advance for your time and candid feedback!
