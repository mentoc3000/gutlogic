Thank you for volunteering to beta test Gut Logic, an app to help people identify and manage their food sensitivities.

This version contains the following features and improvements:
1. In the Analysis section, tap pie chart to view the foods in each slice
2. Improved date selection interface in entries in the Timeline

Spend a few days with the app and send any feedback to dev@gutlogic.co. We will accept feedback on this beta version until Mar 17. Thanks in advance for your time and candid feedback!
